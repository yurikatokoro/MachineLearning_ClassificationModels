Cassification modeling with Apprentice Chef, Inc. dataset to predict cross-selling success of the new promotion

-Overview-<br>
Apprentice Chef, Inc. launched a cross-selling promotion called "Halfway There" where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday. Their main objective here is to find out which customers will subscribe to this service by using a classification model to predict cross-sell success (1 = success, 0 = failure).

This is my second supervised learning project in the Machine Learning cource at Hult International Business School.
